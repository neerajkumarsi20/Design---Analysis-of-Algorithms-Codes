### About This Repository

This repository is a collection of all the Design and Analysis of Algorithms programming work I completed in my college journey.


This repository contains all the code I've written, along with some reference code from other sources. Feel free to use or modify it — it's all available under the MIT License.

### Techniques Explored

- Divide and conquer algorithms like merge sort and quicksort  
- Dynamic programming techniques for LCS, matrix chain multiplication, and maximum subarray  
- Greedy method applied in activity selection  
- Backtracking for subset sum problems  
- Sorting techniques including counting sort, radix sort, bucket sort, and heap sort  
- String pattern matching and randomized approaches for performance improvement
